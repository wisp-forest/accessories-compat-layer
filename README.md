## [WIP] Accessories Compatibility Layer

Using Accessories as the framework, this mod acts as a wrapper for both Trinkets and Curios, using mixin patches on top of both mods. It is designed with support for a Connector or Kilt, meaning trinkets or curios support will work on fabric or neoforge.

### Requires: 
- [Accessories](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories/)
- [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) and/or [Curios](https://modrinth.com/mod/curios)

### Replaces: 
The following compat layers are **no longer** when using this version:
- [Trinkets Compat Layer](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories-tc-layer)
- [Curios Compat Layer](https://modrinth.com/mod/accessories-cc-layer)

### Issues:
- All screens or renderings for such have been unified to the Accessories Screen for the time being
- Curios: Some features are know problems and will be attempted to be resolved within the future
  - Active states are currently unimplemented, meaning mods taking advantage of such will be unable to control state of equipped accessories
  - `ICurioSlotExtension` is not implemented, meaning any stack replacement or tooltip adjustments will not work
